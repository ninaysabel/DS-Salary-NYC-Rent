The purpose of this dashboard is to allow people who have a data-centralized career-- Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, etc. -- who are looking to move to New York City an opportunity to view apartment availability based on various criteria: a specific rent range, neighborhood/burrow, or desired amenities. The motivation behind this project lays in me being a hopeful, future New York City resident as I was born there and have grown a keen fondness for the city. I hope to someday be able to use this dashboard as a helpful tool in apartment hunting one day (with an updated dataset of course)!

Having taken Communicating with Data in a prior semester, I was lucky enough to already know a great deal of visualization inspirations and skills (radio buttons, widgets, formatting, etc.) and was able to apply those to this project.
