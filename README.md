The purpose of this dashboard is to allow people who have a data-centralized career-- Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, etc. -- who are looking to move to New York City an opportunity to view apartment availability based on various criteria: a specific rent range, neighborhood/burrow, or desired amenities. The motivation behind this project lays in me being a hopeful, future New York City resident as I was born there and have grown a keen fondness for the city. I hope to someday be able to use this dashboard as a helpful tool in apartment hunting one day (with an updated dataset of course)!

Having taken Communicating with Data in a prior semester, I was lucky enough to already know a great deal of visualization inspirations and skills (radio buttons, widgets, formatting, etc.) and was able to apply those to this project. My biggest struggle, and subsequently biggest learning curve, was the GeoPandas library which I used to create an interactive map of the metropolitan area. Because I wanted it to interact with the four widgets I had created, figuring out the callback function was more difficult than I intended. But I prevailed! Along with this, I greatly increased my HTML and CSS skills, a skill that was once at a very novice level has now grown to an intermediate level; and for that I am extremely grateful as it is definitely a skill I look forward to using in my future professional career as a data scientist!
